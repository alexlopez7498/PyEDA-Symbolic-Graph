# PyEDA-Symbolic-Graph
Project involves using Python and the pyEDA package to represent a graph with 32 nodes and defined edges based on modular arithmetic conditions. The goal is to utilize Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to perform computations on this graph, including calculating transitive closures and evaluating specific statements about node reachability. Key steps include defining BDDs for graph sets, computing compositions and transitive closures of these sets, and using BDD operations to evaluate a logical statement regarding node connectivity.
